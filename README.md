# Path-between-any-two-nodes
Given a binary tree we have to print the path between any two nodes in the binary tree.

<br/>
The idea is to use the LCA(lowest common ancestor) concept to find out the path between any two nodes in the binary tree.
Once we find the LCA nodes, we use two vectors to print the left path and the right path.
